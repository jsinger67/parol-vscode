This is a VS Code extension to support [`parol`](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol.git)'s syntax
of grammar description files (.par files).

## Features

The extension currently supports syntax highlighting, folding and language icons.
When you install the parol language server you get the best support. See below for instructions.

I hope these features are helpful for you and improve your workflow.

Further development on this extension is planned.

## Installation

Install this extension from VS Code marketplace
[parol-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsinger67.parol-vscode)
To be able to use the full Language Server capabilities please install `parol-ls` on your platform
using the following command.

```shell
cargo install parol-ls
```

Alternatively you can clone the [repository](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol-ls) and build the
language server from sources.

Please check regularly for updates.
